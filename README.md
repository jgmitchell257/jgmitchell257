### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I spend most of my work days working with Cisco products (UC and Webex). If you find anything here useful, feel free to steal it, that's why it's here. I wish more stuff was free and open so we didn't have to constantly reinvent the wheel when we want to do something.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building python tools for managing and monitoring Cisco UC server clusters and apps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... ultramarathons, they're absurd.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been using versions of RedHat Linux since RH5 which you could buy in a box from Walmart :O
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jgmitchell gmail com
